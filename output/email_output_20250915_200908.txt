Hi Gaurav,

I’m reaching out because ML platform teams at global consumer brands are standardizing how they deploy and scale models across ecommerce, membership, and supply chain—especially around high-variance events like SNKRS/product drops and BFCM. TrueFoundry is an ML/LLMOps platform that runs on Kubernetes and integrates with existing data/ETL stacks to shorten prototype-to-production from months to weeks.

Where we can help Nike:
- Unified deployment across ecommerce, membership, and supply chain on EKS/GKE/on‑prem, with one workflow and approvals.
- Burst autoscaling and traffic shaping for drop-day spikes; canary/blue‑green with automatic rollback on metric regression.
- Inference routing and A/B testing for ranking/recs with online/offline feature parity.
- Cost observability by model/team/region with showback/chargeback, token/compute budgets, and right-sizing across GPU/CPU pools.
- Multi-region low-latency inference and caching, plus RBAC, audit trails, and PII-safe logs.

A few questions to see fit:
- How are canary rollouts coordinated today across ecommerce and membership when features drift?
- Do you enforce per-team budgets or token caps to prevent cost runaways during drops?
- What’s the split of your serving stack across EKS/GKE vs on-prem or edge?

Happy to share an anonymized retail case on drop-day stability and cost control. Open to a 20-minute discussion next week?

Hi Gaurav,

Quick nudge as you plan for upcoming drops. Teams like yours typically see fast wins by:
- Putting autoscaling + circuit breakers in front of search/recs to absorb 10x spikes without paging on-call.
- Enforcing per-model budgets and alerts so spend doesn’t spill across regions/teams.
- Standardizing canary + auto-rollback so rollouts don’t require war rooms.

If helpful, I can map this to your Snowflake/Databricks + Airflow/DBT + Kubernetes setup and share a reference architecture. Could you spare 20 minutes this or next week?

Best,
[Your Name]

On-prem LLM serving with eval gates, budgets, and audit for Bloomberg

2) Message #1
Hi Sebastian,

Many finance/data orgs are moving LLM/NLP research into production on existing on‑prem GPU/Kubernetes estates while holding a high bar on evaluation, latency, and compliance. TrueFoundry helps bridge research to reliable services without leaving your clusters.

What we provide:
- On-prem-first serving on existing K8s/GPU with MIG-aware scheduling, quotas, preemption, and cost/latency SLOs.
- Evaluation and release gating: offline test harness, slice-based eval, statistical A/B gating, and guardrails before traffic shifts.
- Multi-model routing: policy-based selection among proprietary/open models with per-request audit logging and data residency controls.
- Inference observability: per-tenant token/compute budgets, tail-latency tracking, autoscaling, and circuit breakers.
- Governance and provenance: dataset/model lineage, signed artifacts, approvals, RBAC, and audit trails.
- Clean integrations with retrieval systems/vector stores while enforcing access controls.

A couple of questions:
- How are LLM releases gated today (by slice/risk tier), and who signs off?
- Are you using MIG partitions or preemption to share GPUs across tenants, and is hot-spotting a challenge?
- Do you need per-product budgets and chargeback for shared inference clusters?

Happy to walk through how similar market-data teams approach this. Open to a 20-minute discussion?

Best,

Hi Sebastian,

Following up with two quick starting points we’ve seen deliver outsized value:
- Add a slice-based eval harness + A/B gating in front of your existing LLM service so only passing models receive traffic.
- Enable MIG-aware scheduling with per-tenant budgets to prevent noisy neighbors and cost overruns.

If you share a bit about your current K8s/GPU layout and evaluation criteria, I can tailor a focused demo. Would 20 minutes this or next week work?

Best,
[Your Name]

Clinical-grade ML to OR/robot systems: signed updates, validation gates, audit

2) Message #1
Hi Nidhi,

For regulated robotics/medical-device teams, the challenge is moving models from research into controlled clinical deployment with airtight change control. TrueFoundry helps standardize that path while respecting hospital connectivity and privacy constraints.

What we enable:
- Hybrid/edge deployment to OR/robot systems with offline-safe updates, signed artifacts, staged rollouts, and automatic rollback.
- GPU utilization management across research clusters and constrained devices: priority queues, quotas, and right-sizing across GPU/CPU.
- Validation gates before promotion to clinical: dataset/model lineage, reproducibility, bias/safety checks, and acceptance tests.
- PHI/PII-aware logging with redaction and retention policies; RBAC, approvals, and comprehensive audit trails for FDA/EU documentation.
- Smart routing between on-device and cloud inference based on latency/privacy SLOs and fallback policies.
- Integrations with existing data lakes, experiment trackers, and CI/CD to reduce time from prototype to controlled clinical deployment.

To align:
- What does your release checklist look like to move a model onto robots/OR endpoints?
- Do you require offline update windows and rollbacks for sites with intermittent connectivity?
- How are PHI logs handled today—redaction at source, sink, or both?

Happy to share an anonymized med-device rollout example. Open to a 20-minute discussion?

Best,
[Your Name]
TrueFoundry

Hi Nidhi,

Bumping this in case it’s timely. Teams see quick risk reduction by:
- Codifying clinical validation gates (lineage, bias/safety checks) as promotion policies tied to approvals.
- Shipping signed, offline-safe updates with staged rollouts and auto-rollback to last-known-good.
- Enforcing quotas on shared GPUs so research doesn’t starve clinical services.

If you share your current CI/CD, experiment tracker, and deployment targets, I can map a concrete plan in 20 minutes. Would next week work?

Best,
[Your Name]
