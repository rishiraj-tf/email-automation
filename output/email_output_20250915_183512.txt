(Introduction)
Hi Karl,

I’ve been following integrate.ai’s work on privacy-preserving ML—especially enabling cross-silo learning without moving data. From the outside, it looks like your team repeatedly ships aggregator/worker services into heterogeneous, customer-controlled K8s/GPU environments while meeting strict governance requirements in financial services and healthcare.

TrueFoundry is a control plane that standardizes how ML services, jobs, and federated workers are packaged, deployed, monitored, and governed across clouds and on‑prem. Teams building PETs use it to cut time from PoC to production at each client site:

- Federated components as templates: opinionated services/jobs/pipelines for coordinators and workers; pinned runtimes (CUDA/PyTorch), reproducible envs, promotion workflows
- GPU/infra efficiency: pooled GPU/CPU scheduling, autoscaling/right‑sizing, and cost showback per tenant/workload
- Governance for regulated buyers: central audit trails, role-based access, approval gates, and standardized deployment policies
- Safer rollouts: canary/blue‑green, health checks, and quick rollback for worker and coordinator updates
- Bring-your-own stack: plug into your registries, experiment trackers, and feature stores with a single operator UX

A few quick questions:
- How are you handling version skew (PyTorch/CUDA vs client GPU drivers) across customer K8s today?
- Do you offer per-client usage/cost visibility for federated runs (e.g., GPU-hours by tenant)?
- What audit artifacts do your regulated customers expect during deployment and training approvals?

Open to a 20‑min architecture review to see if a lightweight control plane behind integrate.ai could simplify cross‑silo rollouts?

Best,

Subject: Re: Unifying integrate.ai’s federated rollouts across client environments

Hi Karl,

Circling back with a concrete way to de-risk federated deployments across customer sites. Here’s how teams in regulated fintech/healthcare use TrueFoundry for PETs/federated learning rollouts:

- Week 1: Model your aggregator/worker as reusable templates with pinned runtimes; register two representative client clusters (different GPU/driver stacks); set per-tenant policies (RBAC, quotas) and cost showback
- Week 2: Run a federated job across both clusters; do a canary update of worker images; validate health checks and safe rollback; export an audit trail (who approved what, which versions ran where) for compliance review

This tends to eliminate per‑customer re-plumbing and gives customer success/ops one control plane for deployments, usage, and governance—without changing your PETs stack.

Would a quick working session with your platform lead make sense next week? If helpful, I can come prepared with:
- A federated worker/aggregator template sketch aligned to your current stack
- A draft deployment policy set (approvals, naming, resource limits) for regulated buyers
- A cost/GPU showback view by tenant/workload

If there’s someone on your team who owns these rollouts, happy to coordinate directly.

Best,
[Your Name] | TrueFoundry
