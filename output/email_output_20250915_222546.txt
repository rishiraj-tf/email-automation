Hi Gaurav,

Given Nike’s mix of store, mobile, and web experiences, how are you deploying and governing personalization/reco models across edge/on‑prem/cloud today?

TrueFoundry provides a control plane that sits on top of your existing stack to take models and prompts from prototype to safe production at Nike scale:
- Single deployment workflow across store/edge devices, on‑prem K8s, and cloud
- Blue/green and shadow rollouts with automatic rollback on KPI regression
- Centralized model/prompt versioning with lineage from dataset → training → endpoint
- Strict RBAC, approval workflows, and audit logs for PII/sensitive data
- GPU/DB resource governance with cost/latency observability per service
- Offline/online A/B evaluation dashboards to correlate lab vs live performance

In a recent retail deployment, we centralized model/prompt versioning and enabled shadow + blue/green rollouts across web and store endpoints—happy to share the case study.

Would a 20‑minute chat be useful to map this to one journey and see if a low‑risk pilot makes sense?

A few quick questions:
1) Do you run blue/green or shadow tests for new ranking/prompt variants across regions?
2) How do you handle rollouts to stores with intermittent connectivity?
3) Is there unified cost/latency tracking for LLM-backed experiences?

Best,

Hi Gaurav,

Quick nudge in case this got buried.

A concrete pilot we’ve run with retail teams:
- Shadow a new recommender to 5% of traffic in 3 regions; track KPI deltas and latency
- Enforce RBAC + approvals for features touching PII
- Promote to blue/green with auto‑rollback if add‑to‑cart, conversion, or latency degrades
- Push the same model to edge store endpoints with staged rollout windows and offline caching

We don’t replace tools like Databricks/SageMaker/Snowflake/Kafka/Kubernetes—TrueFoundry layers on to orchestrate deployments, versioning, governance, and eval across environments.

Open to 20 minutes next week (Tue–Thu) to explore fit? If you’re not the right owner for ML/LLM rollout governance, who would you recommend I speak with?

Thanks,
[Your Name]

Operationalizing GEM‑grade eval for BloombergGPT

2) Email body for Message #1
Hi Sebastian,

I’ve followed your work on GEM—pushing for reliable, comparable NLG evaluation. At Bloomberg, with domain models like BloombergGPT, the challenge is turning that rigor into a repeatable, compliant pipeline from dataset → prompt/model → deployed endpoint.

TrueFoundry provides an LLM evaluation and deployment control plane built for hybrid/on‑prem needs:
- Prompt/model versioning with regression dashboards and slice‑based analysis
- Offline metrics (task‑specific + factuality/faithfulness) and human‑in‑the‑loop sampling
- Lineage from datasets and labelers to train jobs to production endpoints
- Cost/latency observability and routing across internal models and external APIs
- RBAC, approvals, and audit logs suitable for finance compliance

We recently helped a financial NLP team standardize LLM eval with slice‑level gates and human sampling before promotion—happy to share the anonymized case.

Curious:
1) How are you calibrating LLM‑as‑judge against human panels for tasks like financial summarization/headline gen?
2) Do you auto‑sample production traces to refresh eval sets while preserving privacy?
3) What does the handoff look like from research eval assets to production gating?

Open to a 20‑minute deep dive?

Best,

Hi Sebastian,

Following up with a concrete pilot idea to reduce eval friction:
- Stand up a standardized harness for 1–2 tasks (e.g., earnings‑call summarization, QA over filings)
- Define schemas, slices, and guardrails (numeric consistency, entity grounding/citations)
- Run offline eval + stratified human sampling; calibrate LLM‑as‑judge to human scores
- Wire promotion gates so prompt/model changes can’t ship unless key slices hit targets
- Deploy on‑prem with full lineage/audit; monitor cost/latency post‑release

We plug into existing tools (Kubernetes, Ray, Triton/vLLM, internal labeling, Snowflake/Databricks) and keep data in your environment.

Would you be open to a short session, or could you point me to the infra/eval owner who’d be best to loop in?

Thanks,
[Your Name]


PROSPECT: Nidhi Gupta — Intuitive

1) Subject line
Traceable, Part 11–friendly ML control plane for regulated robotics

2) Email body for Message #1
Hi Nidhi,

Congrats on the da Vinci 5 FDA clearance—big milestone. As Intuitive grows its digital/AI capabilities, many medtech teams are looking for a governed path to move perception/LLM components from R&D to clinical builds with full traceability.

TrueFoundry provides an ML control plane tailored for regulated settings:
- End‑to‑end lineage: dataset → training → validation → approval → deployment
- Immutable audit trails, RBAC, and e‑signature approval workflows (Part 11–friendly)
- Environment promotion gates with documented acceptance criteria and reviewers
- Offline/online evaluation dashboards for perception and LLM components
- Hybrid/on‑prem GPU orchestration, including air‑gapped options
- Cost/throughput observability and reproducible builds

We layer over existing tools (ROS/ROS2, Kubernetes/Slurm, Databricks/Snowflake) and generate evidence you can attach to DHF and V&V packages. Happy to share an anonymized medtech case study.

A few quick questions:
1) How do you maintain traceability from surgical video datasets to deployed model binaries on device?
2) What automated gates/approvals are required to include an AI update in a clinical release?
3) Do you require air‑gapped training/inference, and how is GPU capacity allocated across R&D vs V&V?

Open to a 20‑minute discussion to see if this maps to your design controls?

Best,
[Your Name]

Hi Nidhi,

Bumping this with a concrete pilot outline:
- Target one perception model (e.g., instrument segmentation); stand up lineage from dataset to deployed artifact
- Define promotion gates (safety/accuracy thresholds, latency on target hardware) with e‑signature approvals
- Produce an exportable evidence bundle (model card, audit log, test runs) for the DHF
- Run on your on‑prem or air‑gapped K8s with RBAC/audit aligned to your QMS

If helpful, I can share a sample mapping of our artifacts to 21 CFR Part 11 and IEC 62304 documentation expectations.

Would a brief call next week make sense? If someone else owns ML governance or V&V tooling, I’d appreciate an intro.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
