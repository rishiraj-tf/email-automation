SUBJECT: Nike | Predictable ML at retail scale: personalization, search, demand

MESSAGE #1:
----------------------------------------
Hi Gaurav,
Retail AI teams are feeling the pain of moving models from notebooks to reliable, cost-controlled services across personalization, demand forecasting, search/ranking, and content generation. TrueFoundry standardizes this end-to-end so launches stay fast and costs predictable.

Where we typically help global retailers:
- One control plane to deploy across on‑prem and cloud with GPU/CPU autoscaling, per‑team quotas, and budgets
- CI/CD for ML with approval gates, canary/A/B, and reversible releases
- Central registry with dataset/model lineage, plus live observability on latency, drift, and cost per inference (handles seasonality spikes)
- Integrations with existing data lakes/warehouses and experiment trackers
- PII governance, secrets management, and audit logs for retail compliance

Peers in global retail use TrueFoundry to unify model deployment across recsys and demand models while keeping holiday spike costs in check.

A few questions to see if this maps to Nike:
- How are you promoting models from research to production across teams today—central workflow or team‑specific?
- Do you run hybrid (on‑prem + one/multi‑cloud) and need regional quota/cost guardrails?
- How do you track drift and unit cost per inference during big seasonal drops?

Open to a 20‑minute working session next week to dive into your stack and gaps?

Best,
Team at TrueFoundry

Hi Gaurav,
Quick nudge. Two concrete things we could show in a short demo:
- Canary rollout for a personalization model with live cost-per-inference and latency SLOs
- Hybrid deployment with autoscaling and budget caps to handle seasonal surges

Retail teams using TrueFoundry have standardized approvals and rollbacks across personalization and demand forecasting while keeping costs predictable.

Would a brief walkthrough next Tue–Thu morning PT be useful?

Best,
Team at TrueFoundry

Hi Sebastian,
We help LLM‑heavy teams in finance move research to production with the security, evaluation rigor, and cost controls they need. TrueFoundry provides secure GPU orchestration plus promotion workflows tailored for low‑latency inference and regulated environments.

Highlights relevant to finance/LLM teams:
- Air‑gapped or VPC‑isolated training/fine‑tuning/eval; multi‑cluster scheduling honoring data locality (on‑prem + cloud)
- Policy‑gated promotions with reversible releases; blue/green and canary for inference services
- Cost per token/inference and latency SLO tracking; per‑team budgets with automated right‑sizing
- Evaluation pipelines for robustness, bias, and red‑teaming with dataset/model lineage and reproducible runs
- Detailed audit logs and fine‑grained access controls

Peer financial institutions use TrueFoundry to standardize LLM evaluation and production rollouts while maintaining strict security and cost governance.

Curious:
- How are you gating model promotion from research to prod while keeping runs reproducible and auditable?
- Do you need air‑gapped eval/training with zero‑egress and ephemeral credentials?
- How are you tracking cost per token and latency SLOs across teams and model variants?

Open to a 20‑minute deep dive on a secure, air‑gapped workflow?

Best,
Team at TrueFoundry

Hi Sebastian,
Following up with two specifics we’re often asked to demo:
- Evaluation‑as‑CI: automated robustness/bias/red‑team pipelines that must pass before promotion
- Budget and SLO guardrails: per‑team cost caps, auto right‑sizing, and alerts on latency or spend drift

This pattern has helped finance teams keep LLM inference reliable and within budget. Would a short session next week be helpful?

Best,
Team at TrueFoundry


PROSPECT: Nidhi Gupta at Intuitive

1) Subject: Intuitive | Traceable ML for surgical robotics: gated releases + edge deployment

2) Message #1:
Hi Nidhi,
In surgical robotics, audit‑ready traceability and tightly controlled releases are essential. TrueFoundry helps medtech ML teams run reproducible training/eval, enforce promotion gates, and deploy inference on hospital/edge environments with strong controls.

What we enable for regulated device teams:
- End‑to‑end traceability: dataset/feature/model lineage, code/params, approvals, immutable audit trails
- Change control with human‑in‑the‑loop reviews, canary rollouts, and fast rollback for safety‑critical updates
- Offline‑capable, signed containers for hospital/on‑prem or edge sites with centralized policy sync
- Observability on latency, accuracy, drift, and cost per inference; post‑market monitoring and retraining triggers
- Efficient GPU/CPU scheduling for video/sensor workloads, with quotas and access controls aligned to GxP/FDA expectations

Peers in regulated medtech use TrueFoundry to cut audit prep time and de‑risk on‑site deployments.

Questions:
- How do you capture dataset → model → inference traceability today for audits?
- Do hospital sites require offline/air‑gapped operation with centralized policy management?
- What does your change‑control and validation path look like for ML in or near the surgical workflow?

Open to a 20‑minute session to map this to a specific workload (e.g., video tool detection)?

Best,
Team at TrueFoundry

3) Message #2:
Hi Nidhi,
Quick follow‑up with two practical demos we can tailor:
- Audit‑ready release package: linked dataset versions, training run, signed container, approval log, and rollback plan
- Edge deployment: offline‑capable inference container with policy sync, telemetry buffering, and controlled updates

If this aligns with your validation and post‑market surveillance needs, would a brief walkthrough next week make sense?

Best,
Team at TrueFoundry
